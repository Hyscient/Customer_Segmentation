# Customer_Segmentation
Customer Segmentation with Cohort & RFM Analysis
Introduction
This project aims to analyze customer behavior using two popular techniques in marketing analytics: cohort analysis and RFM analysis. The data used in this project is a sample e-commerce dataset that contains customer transactional data from October to December 2019.

The main objective of this project is to identify different customer segments based on their purchase behavior, which will help the business better understand its customers and develop targeted marketing strategies to increase sales and customer retention.

Results
# The analysis of the customer transactional data using cohort and RFM analysis led to the following insights:

Two unique cohorts were identified: one from October 2019 and one from November 2019. The first cohort made their first purchase on average 1014.33 days (about 33.5 months) after their first view, and there were 5 customers who made a purchase in the second month after their first view. On the other hand, the second cohort made their first purchase on average 750.67 days (about 24.8 months) after their first view, but there were no customers who made a purchase in the second month after their first view.

Four customer segments were identified based on their purchase behavior: high-value, loyal customers; recent customers; potentially loyal customers; and churning customers. The high-value, loyal customers were found to be the most valuable segment, as they had the highest RFM score and contributed to the highest revenue. The churning customers were identified as the segment that required the most attention, as they had the lowest RFM score and contributed the least revenue.
